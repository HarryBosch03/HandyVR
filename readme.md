# HandyVR

## TL;DR

HandyVR is a pet project to make a framework in Unity providing physics based VR hands, similar to Half-Life: Alyx.

## Installation

HandyVR can be installed in Unity by pasting the Repository link [https://github.com/HarryBosch03/HandyVR.git](https://github.com/HarryBosch03/HandyVR.git) into the `Add package from git URL...` option in Unity's package manager.

## Branches
- The [`main`]() branch will contain release candidates for the package.
- The [`dev`]() branch will contain work in progress updates when features have been "finished".
- The [`sync`]() is for work in progress, there is no guarantee, in fact I would assume, that the commits in this branch will not work, as they are for me syncing the project across machines.
