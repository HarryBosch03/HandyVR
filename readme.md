# HandyVR

## TL;DR

HandyVR is a pet project to make a framework in Unity providing physics based VR hands, similar to Half-Life: Alyx. This project is for my personal use, however feel free to use it or take inspiration from it.

## Installation

HandyVR can be installed in Unity by pasting the Repository link [https://github.com/HarryBosch03/HandyVR.git](https://github.com/HarryBosch03/HandyVR.git) into the `Add package from git URL...` option in Unity's package manager.

## Branches
- The [`main`](https://github.com/HarryBosch03/HandyVR/tree/main) branch will contain release candidates for the package.
- The [`pre-release`](https://github.com/HarryBosch03/HandyVR/tree/pre-release) branch will contain work in progress updates when features have been "finished". Is not guaranteed to be stable, bug free, or work at all.
- The [`unstable`](https://github.com/HarryBosch03/HandyVR/tree/unstable) branch is for my personal use, for syncing changes between my machines, assume this branch does not work, **use at your own risk.**
